## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

### Who am I 
I am a PhD student in Economics working in Freiburg, Germany. I specialize in game theory and applied microeconomics. Currently, I am working on projects about exploitation, such as slavery in history and contemporary times. I am interested in the application of machine learning and innovative empirical techniques in economics. English is my working language, Chinese is my mother language, and I am learning German.  

### Where I come from
I have a bachelor's degree in Finance completed in China and a master's degree in Economics completed in Germany. This background gives me multicultural experiences and a mindset of economics. The multinational experience pushes me to think about the institutional differences and development patterns in different countries. 

### Where do I want to go
I am currently developing myself in academia. My ideal future is a well-trained economist who has good intuition of our contemporary world. Meanwhile, I am eager to implement novel data and data analysis in economic research. 

### How to reach me
I am open to collaboration. If you have cool ideas in economics research, please contact me via *geweicao@gmail.com*
